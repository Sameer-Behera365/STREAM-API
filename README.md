# Java Stream API Demonstration Project

## Overview
This project presents a structured set of Stream API use cases in Java. It demonstrates how functional-style operations can be performed on collections using streams, lambda expressions, and built-in stream methods.

## UC2.1 — Stream creation and element traversal
Build a stream from a collection and iterate through it to display every element.

## UC2.2 — Value transformation using map
Use the map operation to modify each element in the stream (such as multiplying values) and produce transformed output.

## UC2.3 — Collecting transformed results
Gather the processed stream elements into a new List using a collector.

## UC2.4 — Filtering even numbers
Apply a filter condition to extract only even values from the stream.

## UC2.5 — Retrieving the first match
Locate and display the first element in the stream that meets a condition (first even number).

## UC2.6 — Finding minimum and maximum
Identify the lowest and highest values present in the stream.

## UC2.7 — Computing sum and average
Generate summary statistics such as total and average from numeric stream data.

## UC2.8 — Condition matching checks
Verify whether all elements or at least one element satisfies a specified rule.

## UC2.9 — Sorting in ascending order
Sort the stream elements in ascending sequence.
